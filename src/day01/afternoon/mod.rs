    println!("     Explanation: We passed a reference (`&`) to the function. The function borrowed the value but did not take ownership, so `another_string` is still valid.");

    let mut mutable_str = String::from("Can I change?");
    let _ref1 = &mut mutable_str;

    println!("     Explanation: Rust's borrowing rules state you can only have ONE mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This prevents data races.");
